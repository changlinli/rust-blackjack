# rust-blackjack

A very limited and broken version of blackjack written in Rust. It served as a a
small tutorial for me to learn how to use Rust.

## Running and building

This project, like most Rust projects, is built with `cargo`. You'll need it
installed. If you have it `cargo run` from the top-level directory of this
project is all you need.
